For some reason this area has no cell service--hard to believe these days. Fortunately the day is sunny, in the low 70s with a light breeze. At least some thing is going right today. After walking for about 45 minutes you come upon a property boundary fence on your left. You begin to follow the fence, and about 20 minutes later a large red brick home comes in to view. The house appears old and is situated back off the road with a well maintained garden in the front. As you walk up the circular driveway you pass an old car. You step up to the front door and ring the door bell. You hear nothing but the rustling of leaves in the light wind. You wonder if the door bell is working, and after a bit you use the door knocker to summon the occupants. While you wait you check your phone again for cell coverage. You still have no bars. You think to yourself that you could never live in such a rural location. Getting a bit anxious about the situation, you reach out and give the front door a good pounding. The front door pushes slightly open. You pause for a moment then call out for the attention of the occupants. No one responds. You know someone must live here with the garden as well tended as it is, and the car behind you in the driveway. The house looks large and the occupants probably didn't hear you. You really need to use their phone, as it is, it will probably take an hour or more for the tow truck to show up. You step inside the small entry, calling out again to the occupants. No one responds. You close the door behind yourself.");

As you step up to the door standing ajar, you hear soft sobbing coming from the garage. You pull the door open and see an old man sitting, legs crossed, on the garage floor. He is leaning against a wooden post, hunched over. His left hand loosely is gripping a silver revolver which rests on his left thigh. As you think back to what you've seen in the house, you have a pretty good idea why this man sits here with a loaded gun.

He slowly looks up at you with tears running down his face and tells you he is 'all alone now, all alone...' His head then droops to his chest once again, and his tears resume their fall to his lap. 'I haven't been alone a single day since marrying her. ...and now there is no one' the man says, through sobs. Part of you wants to run, to seek the cool fresh air and freedom which outside provides. Freedom from the grief which fills this dark opressive space and threatens to suffocate you both. The other part of you wants to say the right thing, the thing that will make it survivable, the words you don't know, and that part is very afraid of saying the wrong thing. /n You can use the command continue or leave.", "You take a slow deep breath of hot heavy air, move over to the man, and sit next to him on the floor. You say 'We are never really alone. Our loved ones are always in our hearts and minds, and things they have touch surround us daily. And people we've never met walk into our lives...at the most unexpected times. The man tilts his head toward you looks at you for a moment, closes his eyes and nods his head. You lightly lay your right on the revolver and take the gun from his hand. The man does not resist. He burries his face in his hands and the tears come again as he greevs for his wife. You sit sit quietly and an rub his back for a long while. When his sobs begin to slow, you tell him your are going to the house to get him a glass of water. You exit the garage, with the intent to call the police to report the death, and absent mindedly pull out your cell phone. There, on the east side of the property, outside a small dark barn full of more grief than you had ever experienced, you find two bars of reception. More than enough to make a call.");
